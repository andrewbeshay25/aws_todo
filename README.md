# Simple To-Do List Using AWS Lambda Functions

Welcome to my very first project that uses Lambda Functions. 


### This To-DO List consists of the following:
## CRUD:
- Creating todo items
- Reading and displaying the current To-Do items
- Updating current To-Do items
- Deleting To-Do items

## Web Development: 
- Uses HTML and CSS to create the visual layout of the web page
- HTML and JS work hand in hand to fetch and display to-do's from and to the Lambda functions
